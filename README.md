# Where are the healthcare-related blockchains?
![healthcare blockchain](healthcare-blockchain.png)
We've drafted an open-source landscape map for healthcare-related blockchains. This repository was inspired by conversations with [Paul](https://github.com/pfletcherhill) from [PatientBank](https://www.patientbank.us) and Chris from [Hashed Health](https://hashedhealth.com). We wanted to answer the question: *Who is working on blockchain-related technologies for our industry?*

## Overview & Methodology
There's a lot of opportunity to use blockchain technologies in healthcare -- [and there are a lot of myths, too](https://blog.andreacoravos.com/myth-busting-can-a-blockchain-save-healthcare-d398cdebf0c1).

We put together a first cut of this map and wanted to open it up to the community to share updates. Many of the companies on this list are early stage (e.g., vaporware). Over time, we hope to see more projects in production, but few are ready yet.

You can fork the [landscape map slide (Google Slides)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yJ9d4w0HpSJ8Wccc3hQQGNmZmqCSwExiFOFWXPVaPvY/edit?usp=sharing). *To add your company to the map, please add your logo to the [Logos folder](https://github.com/acoravos/healthcare-blockchains/tree/master/logos) when making a pull request or else we will be unable to accept your request.*
